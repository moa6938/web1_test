    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>

    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,<br>
      including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve<br>
      content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the<br>
      specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web<br>
      pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate<br>
      .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural<br>
      content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the<br>
      page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
